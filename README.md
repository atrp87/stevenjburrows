My name is Steven, if you haven't already guessed and I have recently changed my career into software development.

To help me with this change I went ot Code Clan in Edinburgh and in my repo I have some of the task they set out for us and some projects I have done since I graduated from Code Clan.

This is just the start of my README file so come back for more updates
